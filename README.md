# **Restaurant App Final Project**
By Justin Castillo and Dasani Millien

## -Functionality
This program is called Restaurant Management System. We chose the Restaurant Ordering project where a C++ program has to handle restaurant ordering and billing operations. A restaurant has expanded and allows orders to be placed across different methods like Doordash, Phone, Drive-Through, and Onsite. We used six classes to create this program: ‘chef’ manages order processing, ‘menu’ displays items and handles pricing, ‘order’ handles individual customer orders, ‘ordermanager’ manages all system orders and save and reload states, ‘receipt’ generates receipts, and ‘role’ prompts you to choose between the customer and the chef. Key features include a save and reload state where it saves orders placed by the customer and can view them as a chef. We also included role-based access where only customers can place and save orders and chefs can manage and process saved orders. The program includes multiple methods of order like doordash, onsite, phone, and drive-through. Another key feature is that as a chef you can view the order’s order based on priority, even though the customer can put in a different way the program which shows the orders in a list according to priority.

## -How to Use
To use the program you start the program and select a role between customer or chef, it is best to choose the customer first because you won’t have any orders to process as chef. As a customer, you can place multiple orders and save them before exiting the program. Reload the program again and enter as a chef to then process the saved orders using the available options like start cooking orders, complete them, and cancel them and more.
## -Team Member Contributions
Justin Castillo and Dasani Millien worked together to complete this project. We had an equal list of classes that can be split between the both of us and would frequently communicate how things are going on our end to eventually combine our work. Justin Castillo mainly worked on the ordermanager, chef, and role files while Dasani mainly worked on the receipt, order, and menu files.
